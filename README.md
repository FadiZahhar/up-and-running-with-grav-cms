### Envato Tuts+ Course: Up and Running with Grav CMS
#### Instructor: [Kezz Bracey](https://tutsplus.com/authors/kezz-bracey)

In this course you're going to learn how Grav CMS works, how to use it, and how to hand code a Grav theme from scratch with every aspect explained along the way.

Grav is a flat file CMS, meaning you get a fast, sophisticated and flexible CMS without ever having to worry about databases. There are no complicated installation processes, and all content is powered by Markdown.

By the end of this course you'll understand the fundamentals of how Grav operates, the three different types of content it uses, how its file structure and naming protocols work, and the relationship between Markdown files and theme templates. 

You'll also be creating a theme from the ground up that features a modular homepage, blog and regular pages. You won't be using Grav's theme starter files or any pre-built skeletons, rather you'll construct each file yourself so you get to see how every part of the theme works. A completed CSS stylesheet will be provided however to ensure you can focus on Grav related code.

So let's go ahead and get "Up and Running with Grav CMS".
